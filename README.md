Car Configurator
================

The Car Configurator example showcases an early implementation of the Montage 3D
view component and its integration with the rest of a Montage application.

Installation
------------

You'll need node and npm (http://nodejs.org) to use the npm tool to install dependencies.

Then, after cloning this repository locally:
```
cd carconfigurator
npm install
```

During development Montage applications rely on XHR to load their various
components and modules; you'll need to have a webserver serve the carconfigurator demo.

If you happen to have minit installed (`npm install minit -g`) you can run
`minit serve` from within the carconfigurator directory to set up a server on demand.
